						<h2>What is a life settlement?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>A life settlement is the transfer of ownership and beneficiary rights of an unwanted or unneeded life insurance policy in exchange for a cash settlement. Life Settlements are based on the premise that many individuals no longer need or can afford to keep paying premiums on their insurance policies. The seller no longer has the responsibility of paying future premiums. In exchange, investors profit based on the difference of the face value of the policy and acquisition and maintenance costs. </p>

						<p>The secondary market landscape is dominated by insureds typically aged 65 and older, some with medical impairments resulting in shortened life expectancies. </p>
						<p>Life Settlements became more sophisticated as actuarial techniques and advanced financial analysis were implemented during the underwriting process. With the senior population adhering itself to traditional underwriting guidelines, the Life Settlement industry could then leverage of the existing foundation of the life insurance industry and with a supply of life insurance policies that was exponentially larger has grown into a multi-billion dollar market. The industry today is almost entirely comprised of a few mainstream capital sources that have revolutionized the speed and scale of the secondary insurance market. The industry has also become more specialized with seniors working with financial advisors, brokers and a number of ancillary and service providers.</p>
